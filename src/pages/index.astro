                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    With rapid technological advancements and pressing societal challenges—such as demographic shifts, a shortage of medical professionals, and increasing care demands—our future is undeniably heading toward a hybrid reality where humans and social robots coexist and collaborate across diverse domains. Particularly in healthcare and assistive contexts, social robots are being adopted to support vulnerable populations including older adults, individuals with chronic illnesses, and children with developmental disabilities. These robotic systems promise to augment human capabilities, enhance efficiency, and improve quality of life by offering personalised, continuous, and adaptive assistance tailored to individual needs, habits, and preferences.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    However, the realisation of meaningful and effective human-robot interaction (HRI) requires a nuanced understanding of human behaviour, cultural dynamics, and context-sensitive requirements. Personalisation emerges as a crucial strategy in this pursuit, enabling robots to adapt socially and cognitively to the people they assist. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics—particularly the integration of Large Language Models and cognitive architectures—are facilitating the design of socially intelligent robots capable of emotional communication, mutual affective understanding, and shared mental models that foster trust and long-term collaboration.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Yet, these benefits come with considerable risks. Personalisation may undermine user autonomy by fostering overdependence, diminishing self-sufficiency, or reducing opportunities for personal growth. It risks narrowing users’ worldviews through over-customisation that limits exposure to new ideas, behaviours, or possibilities. Furthermore, as personalisation systems increasingly rely on user data, ethical concerns around privacy, transparency, and trust become paramount. Misaligned or biased personalisation mechanisms could exclude or disadvantage certain groups, threatening inclusivity and equity in human-robot interactions. To realise the potential of a hybrid human-robot future, it is essential to strike a balance that optimises personalisation without compromising user autonomy, diversity, and privacy. Personalisation must respect user agency, encourage exploration beyond comfort zones, and foster equitable and inclusive interactions while safeguarding ethical principles. This requires carefully considering how personalisation is implemented and ensuring its benefits are maximised while potential risks are mitigated.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Contributing Workshops</h3>
                <div class="prose prose-lg">
                    This workshop is the result of blending together three workshops that tackled personalisation from various perspectives: Weighing the benefits of <a href="https://warn-ws.github.io/" target="_blank">Autonomous Robot persoNalisation (WARN)</a>, <a href="https://altruist21.istc.cnr.it/" target="_blank">sociAL roboTs for peRsonalized, continUous and adaptIve aSsisTance (ALTRUIST)</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bailar2024/home" target="_blank">Behavior Adaptation and Learning for Assistive Robotics (BAILAR)</a>. The BEAR workshop aims to critically examine these intersecting dimensions—technical, ethical, and social—by bringing together experts across disciplines. Through Oxford-style debates, interactive brainstorming sessions, and three keynote speakers, participants will explore key questions around the impact of personalisation on user experience and acceptance, the challenges of designing socially intelligent robots, the role of AI in fostering Theory of Mind and empathy in robots, and the long-term implications of deploying such technologies in healthcare and assistive settings. Ultimately, the goal is to advance a multidisciplinary conversation that aligns with the broader interests of the HRI community and contributes to the development of equitable, trustworthy, and effective personalised human-robot interactions.
